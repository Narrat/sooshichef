# sooshichef
This is a small demo application using [libsooshi](https://github.com/ghtyrant/libsooshi) to communicate with the [Mooshimeter](http://moosh.im).
It's using Gtk to display input values from both channels.

Its features are currently very limited.

Feel free to open Pull Requests or Issues!
